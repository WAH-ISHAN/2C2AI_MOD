# Voice-Based AI Chatbot with 2c2ai Integration

## Project Overview
This project is a **voice-based AI chatbot system** designed to provide a friendly, conversational interface for users to interact with an AI assistant powered by the 2c2ai module.  
Users can speak naturally through their microphone, and the chatbot responds both with text and synthesized speech, creating a seamless voice conversation experience.

The chatbot is ideal for customer support, sales inquiries, lead capture, and interactive product information delivery on websites.

## Architecture

The system consists of:

- **Frontend**: React-based web application capturing voice input, displaying conversation, and playing voice responses.
- **Backend**: Node.js server handling chat requests, interacting with the 2c2ai API, and managing conversation flow.
- **AI Module**: 2c2ai integration that understands and replies to user queries.
- **Speech APIs**: Utilizes Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech services, either browser-native Web Speech API or cloud providers like Google, Azure, or Amazon.
